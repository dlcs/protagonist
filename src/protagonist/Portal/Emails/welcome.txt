Dear {recipients},

We have created a new customer in IIIF Cloud Services for you to test the API with: 

Customer Id = {customerId}, Name = {customerName}. 

We have also created a "Space", which is a way to logically group assets:

Space Id = {spaceId}, Name = {spaceName}.

You will be able to create new spaces as required using the API.

The API key is available using the following link. Youâ€™ll need to verify your email address to access it: 

{apiKeyEmail}
 
The username and password are the Basic HTTP Auth credentials for calling the API. 

The root of the API is - https://api.dlc.services/. Using Customer {customerId} and Space {spaceId} you should have the basics that you need to get started.

The simplest test to verify the credentials work is to call GET https://api.dlc.services/customers/{customerId}  with basic auth headers and verify you receive a 200 response.

The API documentation has details on how to ingest assets into IIIF Cloud Services: 

https://dlcs-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walkthroughs/sample_requests.html#queue-assets-for-ingest

As part of setup we have ingested a sample image titled "test-setup" to verify everything was okay. You can see the public-facing URLs generated for this:

* IIIF info.json file: https://dlc.services/iiif-img/{customerId}/{spaceId}/test-setup/info.json
* IIIF Manifest: https://dlc.services/iiif-manifest/{customerId}/{spaceId}/test-setup 
  (in viewer: https://uv-v4.netlify.app/#?manifest=https://dlc.services/iiif-manifest/{customerId}/{spaceId}/test-setup)
* Image request: https://dlc.services/iiif-img/{customerId}/{spaceId}/test-setup/full/!400,400/0/default.jpg
* Thumbnail service: https://dlc.services/thumbs/{customerId}/{spaceId}/test-setup/info.json
* Thumbnail request: https://dlc.services/thumbs/{customerId}/{spaceId}/test-setup/full/!200,200/0/default.jpg

The Thumbnail service is created for any ingested images and can be used to generate UI that involves many thumbnails on screen at once.
The thumbnails are much faster than arbitrary requests to the image service, but they are fixed sizes.
