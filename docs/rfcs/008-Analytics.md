# Analytics

## Context

The DLCS is concerned with serving image (and AV) assets. However, the varying use cases of how these assets are consumed can wildly affect usage patterns. 

For example a Museum may have 100 image that are all large and detailed. Users will tend to open an image and spend a lot of time looking at a single item. This is very different to a user of a Library, where they have 20,000 digitised books, all with multiple pages. These will be a lot smaller than any of the Museum images. How the user interacts will also differ - they may "leaf" through multiple pages in a book, rather that dwelling at a single image.

With this in mind we need deeper insights into how the data is being used to allow it to be handled correctly.
